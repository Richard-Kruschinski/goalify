# Goalify

**Goalify** is a habit and gym tracking app that helps you stay productive and motivated. You can manage your daily to-do list, visualize your overall progress, and log your training weights at the gym. Weight progression can also be tracked and visualized per workout exercise, giving you a clear picture of when it’s time to increase the load.

## Motivation

I started building Goalify because I realized I was losing track of my weight progression in the gym. At the same time, I had been keeping a daily to-do list on a simple whiteboard. To make my everyday life easier and bring both worlds together, productivity and fitness.I decided to create this project and turn it into an app.

## Features

### Daily Tasks
- Reorder tasks via drag & drop
- Check off tasks and earn points
- **Streaks** with **Best Streak** tracking
- **Freeze tokens**: start with 2; earn +1 every 7 days; protect a streak on off days
- Midnight rollover:
  - “Keep” tasks are unchecked daily
  - “Today-only” tasks are removed
- Long-press actions: **Edit**, **Duplicate**, **Move to top**, **Reset streak(s)**, **Delete**
- Persistent custom order  
  (done items sink to bottom; unchecking restores original position)

### Gym Tracking
- Two views: **By Exercise** and **By Workout Day**
- Assign exercises to workout days (Push/Pull/Leg/…)
- Reorder exercises globally and within each day
- Log **weight**, **sets**, and **dropset** flag
- Full **history** dialog per exercise
- Interactive **progress chart** (date ↔ weight):
  - Tooltips with **date** (line 1) and **weight + kg** (line 2)
  - First & latest dates labeled on the x-axis
  - Adaptive y-axis with padding & clean grid (avoids banding for large ranges)
  - Dropset entries visually highlighted

### Progress Visulation
- KPI cards (e.g., Today’s points, trends)
